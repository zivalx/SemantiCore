# Customer Notes – Q2 Review

Acme Corp renewed their Enterprise contract earlier than expected.
Alice is effectively acting as the internal owner of InsightAPI,
even though Legal (Eve) signs the contracts.

Beta Systems is still small, but Carol is pushing for expanded usage
of SecureFlow across multiple teams. No add-on contract yet, but
engineering usage doubled in May.

There were some concerns raised about access control and key rotation,
especially after Dan triggered several SecureFlow security events.
